/**
 * The DeploymentFactoryManager class is a central registry for J2EE DeploymentFactory objects. 
 * 
 * The DeploymentFactoryManager retains references to DeploymentFactory objects loaded by a tool. 
 * A DeploymentFactory object provides a reference to a DeploymentManager. 
 * The DeploymentFactoryManager has been implemented as a singleton. 
 * A tool gets a reference to the DeploymentFactoryManager via the getInstance method. 
 * The DeploymentFactoryManager can return two types of DeploymentManagers, 
 * a connected DeploymentManager and a disconnected DeploymentManager. 
 * The connected DeploymentManager provides access to any product resources that 
 * may be required for configurations and deployment. 
 * The method to retrieve a connected DeploymentManager is getDeploymentManager. 
 * This method provides parameters for user name and password that the product 
 * may require for user authentication. A disconnected DeploymentManager does not 
 * provide access to a running J2EE product. The method to retrieve a disconnected 
 * DeploymentManager is getDisconnectedDeploymentManager. 
 * A disconnected DeploymentManager does not need user authentication information.
